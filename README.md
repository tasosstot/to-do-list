# To-Do List App
A simple, stylish, and responsive to-do list application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This app allows users to add, mark as done, and delete tasks while automatically saving their progress using local storage.

## Features
* Add tasks with timestamps.
* Mark tasks as "done" with a visual indicator (strikethrough and style change).
* Delete tasks easily.
* Save and load tasks automatically using local storage.
* Responsive design for desktop and mobile views.
* Prevents long text overflow with proper word wrapping.


## How It Works
#### 1. Adding a Task:

#### 2. Marking a Task as Done:

#### 3. Click "Done" to mark the task as completed. The task will have a strikethrough and change color.

#### 4. Click "Delete" to remove the task from the list.

#### 5 Local Storage:
The app saves tasks automatically in your browser's local storage.
On reload, all tasks are restored to their last state.


## Future Enhancements
* Add categories or priorities for tasks.
* Enable due dates and notifications.
* Allow task editing.
* Sync tasks across devices using a backend server
